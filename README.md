# kanban-to-do-list

## Project Description
This project is an attempt to master some web development.
For this project, I will probably stick to the traditional PHP/java/javascript/Angular/REACT/JQuery.
The idea of this project is to create a personal to do list in the form of a kanban board.
The details of the project will evolve as I continue to implement some of this material.

##Project Motto
``To do, or not to do? That is the question.`` - Hercule Poirot. ``The mysterious Affair at Styles`` - Agatha Christie
